I am thrilled to announce I have received the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program. This would not have been possible without the support of my advisor, Dr. Elizabeth Qian, and I am immensely grateful for her investment and guidance.

I am happy to report that in Spring 2025, I have passed my Ph.D. qualifying exams for the Computational Science and Engineering Doctor of Philosophy degree. I took two written exams in the areas of Computational Data Analytics and Discrete Algorithms. Following the written exams, I took an oral exam which consisted of a compiled research document and computational artifact. I presented these to a committee of CSE faculty consisting of Dr. Elizabeth Qian (advisor), Dr. Peng Chen (chair), Dr. Raphael Pestourie, Dr. Florian Sch√§fer. I express my profuse thanks to this distinguished group for taking time out of their busy schedules to perform this evaluation.

After much consideration, I have decided not to complete the M.S. in Computational Data Analytics program that I started at Georgia Tech in Fall 2023. Instead, I will pursue a Ph.D. in Computational Science and Engineering under the advisorship of Dr. Elizabeth Qian, to whom I was introduced by my undergraduate mentors Dr. Serkan Gugercin and Dr. Mark Embree. This is largely due to my desire to perform research in numerical methods and data-driven modeling, to pursue undergraduate education, and to develop my technical skillset as an engineer and mathematician.

I am excited to announce that I have accepted an internship for Summer 2024 as a graduate data science intern at Cox Communications! I will be working in the analytics division to uncover novel insights into customer behavior and operations, as well as develop the existing data infrastructure that serves the operations of the branch.

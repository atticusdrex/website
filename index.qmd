# About
I am a Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech in the Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) department with a home unit in Aerospace Engineering. I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a B.S. in Computational Modeling and Data Analytics from Virginia Tech. My research interests include machine learning, surrogate modeling, kernel methods, and uncertainty quantification.

    "text": "Best Buy Project Week 2024: First Place Winner\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Tech MSA Project Week sponsored by Best Buy\nSpring 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeveraged techniques in data mining, dimensionality reduction, parallel computing, and visualization to develop a deep learning model that accurately categorized over 500,000 customer service transcripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Traffic Network Simulation and Modeling the Impact of Pluvial Flash Flooding\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Tech Modeling & Simulation Term Project\nFall 2023\n\n\n\nIn contemporary transportation systems, the management of traffic flow under heavy load and unpredictable events such as flash floods are a critical challenge. The conventional static traffic assignment, where routes are fixed at the onset, is insufficient in addressing real-time variations in trip volumes, accidents, work zones, and weather conditions. Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) is a pragmatic solution, adapting routing strategies continuously to evolving traffic conditions. Existing navigation services, while adept at adapting to incidents like accidents and road closures, often neglect unreported events like flash floods, posing a significant threat to both drivers and system integrity. By simplifying the traffic network setting, we will replicate diverse flooding intensities, enabling comprehensive evaluation of our dynamic traffic assignment strategy. By systematically analyzing these simulations, our research aims to establish a robust and adaptive framework for rerouting under flash flood conditions, thereby enhancing the resilience and safety of modern transportation networks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovering Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations from Data: Epidemiology Case Study\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Tech Data Science for Epidemiology Term Project\nFall 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project outlines how to discover governing differential equations directly from data to determine the overall course of an epidemic. The two methodologies used to accomplish this will be the popular SINDy algorithm, developed by Brunton and Kutz et al. as well as the symbolic regression model applied to the derivative of the model. The group successfully used both methods to recover the SIR model from synthetic data with noise artificially added and to predict COVID-19 data. The PySR model, when effectively regularized showed promise in being able to robustly recover governing differential equations in the presence of noisy data. \n\n\n\nFull Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonlinear Classification Methods for Valuation Changes and Portfolio Optimization\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Tech Computational Data Analytics Term Project\nFall 2023\n\n\n\nThis paper investigates Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Kernel Ridge Regression, and Kernel Support Vector Machines and their ability to predict valuation changes in Exon Mobil stock augmented with exogenous regressors of oil price per barrel, S&P 500 data, google search data, and electric car demand. Further, this report also investigates applying the AdaBoost algorithm to high-frequency trading, optimized and diversified by applying Markowitz Portfolio theory to form a convex minimization problem. The report found that AdaBoost outperformed KRR, and KSVM, especially when the number of rounds of boosting was increased. Further, the portfolio optimization algorithm converged on six companies to apply the algorithm to and outputted the optimal allocation of capital to each strategy. This has strong implications in the field of quantitative finance and was demonstrated to be profitable in this paper. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcho State Networks for Dynamical System Modeling\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia Tech Undergraduate Research Project\nFall 2022 - Spring 2023  Advisor: Serkan Gugercin, Ph.D. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis paper develops a framework for improving upon traditional regression methods to model discrete nonlinear dynamical systems. This framework is derived from a branch of recurrent neural-networks called Echo State Networks (ESNs). This report compares this methodology to the famous Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) framework developed by Brunton et al. This investigation specifically analyzes the Lorenz System as an example nonlinear and chaotic system. In the models investigated within this report, the Linear ESN model outperforms the SINDy algorithm when noise in the system is sufficiently low. The SINDy algorithm is also far more computationally intensive, requiring much more data to yield comparable results. In addition, SINDy requires sampling of a numerical derivative of a signal. Using finite difference methods amplifies any noise present in the signal, and thus, a direct, discrete method for calculating a regularized derivative is proposed, based on the Total Variation Regularized Derivative (TVD). \n\n\n\nFull Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimal Damping for Improved Controllability of Shock Test Fixture\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia Tech Mechanical Engineering Senior Design Project\nFall 2022 - Spring 2023\n\n\n\nNaval antennas require extensive shock testing and evaluation before being deployed on surface warships. The purpose of this project was to design, simulate, validate, manufacture, and test a prototype that emulates shock impacts on naval communication antennas for the Naval Surface Warfare Center - Dahlgren Division (Dahlgren). The team produced an active and a passive solution with priority on modeling sample shock, which is irregular, high-frequency and high-velocity. The full report covers customer needs, concept generation, prototyping, concept down selection, designs, simulation, analysis, and general team attributes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEigenvalue Extraction from Video of Multiple-Mass Pendulum\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia Tech Computational Modeling & Data Analytics Senior Capstone\nSpring 2024\n\nAdvised by Dr. Mark Embree, this project sought to design a hands-on experiment for students in CMDA 3605 courses to see eigenvalues in action. The experiment involved collecting high-speed video of a swinging pendulum with multiple connected masses, converting the video to time series data, processing the time series data to extract the fundamental frequencies, and finally comparing the experimental values to theoretical ones.\n\nFull Report",

The athletes absolutely raved about him–after meeting with him once, they would come into my office demanding more sessions. He has tutored nearly every sport and helped the most difficult students.” -Kayleigh W. (Former Supervisor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“[Atticus] taught me math for the first two and a half years of college. As a full-time D1 athlete with a learning disability, Atticus was the best tutor I had at Virginia Tech. I did not know how to do ANYTHING when we started (like he had to explain basic fractions and algebra). He took me from pre-calc to passing differential equations. He is so enthusiastic and kind, but he also expects effort and a mutual respect. He also worked really hard to support my learning accommodations. A great person and tutor.” -[Anonymous in compliance with NCAA regulation]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Atticus helped my daughter with her pre-calculus and Spanish classes. He was patient, kind, and appeared to know the material backwards and forwards. My daughter likely wouldn’t have passed this class without him. She ended up getting a B and was very proud of herself.” -Beatrice T.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“My son had difficulty understanding his AP Calculus class–he and his teacher didn’t mesh well. After working with Atticus, not only did my son’s grades improve, but his confidence and enjoyment of the subject also increased. It’s obvious Atticus absolutely loves the material and worked hard to make things relevant to my son’s life. I couldn’t recommend Atticus more!” -Melissa C.",

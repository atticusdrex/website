## Testimonials 

:::{.callout-warning collapse="false" appearance="minimal"}

"Atticus is quite possibly the best tutor we have ever hired. He came in and was able to cover seemingly every STEM subject we needed. The athletes absolutely raved about him--after meeting with him once, they would come into my office demanding more sessions. He has tutored nearly every sport and helped the most difficult students." -Kayleigh W. (Former Supervisor)

"[Atticus] taught me math for the first two and a half years of college. As a full-time D1 athlete with a learning disability, Atticus was the best tutor I had at Virginia Tech. I did not know how to do ANYTHING when we started (like he had to explain basic fractions and algebra). He took me from pre-calc to passing differential equations. He is so enthusiastic and kind, but he also expects effort and a mutual respect. He also worked really hard to support my learning accommodations. A great person and tutor." -[Anonymous in compliance with NCAA regulation]

"Atticus helped my daughter with her pre-calculus and Spanish classes. He was patient, kind, and appeared to know the material backwards and forwards. My daughter likely wouldn't have passed this class without him. She ended up getting a B and was very proud of herself." -Beatrice T.

"My son had difficulty understanding his AP Calculus class--he and his teacher didn't mesh well. After working with Atticus, not only did my son's grades improve, but his confidence and enjoyment of the subject also increased. It's obvious Atticus absolutely loves the material and worked hard to make things relevant to my son's life. I couldnâ€™t recommend Atticus more!" -Melissa C.
